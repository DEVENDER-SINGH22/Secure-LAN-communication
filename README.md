# Secure-LAN-communication
h# Hybrid Secure Communication System (RSA + AES)

This project demonstrates a secure LAN-based communication system
using hybrid encryption techniques.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Socket Programming
- RSA (Public Key Cryptography)
- AES (Fernet Symmetric Encryption)

## How It Works
1. Server generates RSA key pair
2. Client receives public key
3. Client generates AES session key
4. AES key is encrypted using RSA
5. Secure encrypted messaging over LAN
